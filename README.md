This Python code implements a Flask API that incorporates rate limiting and caching to manage incoming requests efficiently. The API is designed to limit the number of requests per certain time intervals and cache responses to reduce the load on the server and improve response times.

Dependencies:
Flask: A lightweight web application framework for Python.
Flask-Limiter: An extension for rate limiting requests in Flask applications.
Flask-Caching: An extension for adding caching support to Flask applications.

Endpoint Details:
/api/data: This endpoint returns a JSON response containing a sample message. It is rate-limited to 10 requests per minute and cached for 60 seconds.
This README provides an overview of the Flask API implementation with rate limiting and caching.
